# iOSWallet

FootballCoin is currently moving to a new blockchain solution hosted on the Multichain platform.
The SPV wallet will allow players to store their in-game assets. We'd like to make the SPV wallet development a sponsored community effort.
Our reasoning is that everyone (us included) wants development times to be as short as possible and we're sure there's talent in the community.

Sponsoring this effort will make sure that it's worth it for everyone.

Here's what we're offering:
- GitHub repo where users can contribute (and get paid accordingly);
- Code samples, graphic (UI kit) and API for assets;
- Advice, guidelines and documentation;
- Bounties in BTC;
- Slack channel to discuss;
- Positive attitude :)

The project is based on a fork of bitcoinj and other than general SPV wallet requirements should also feature:
- Storage (send/receive/display) of all platform assets: XFC, player cards, stadium cards;
- Address Book function (users should be able to link their in-game address in the wallet for easy exachanges between game account and wallet)

Below are some forks of popular bitcoin wallets and libraries, for connecting to a MultiChain blockchain. These work with both [bitcoin-style](https://www.multichain.com/developers/creating-connecting/#bitcoin-style) blockchains and [bitcoin-compatible](https://www.multichain.com/developers/peer-handshaking/#bitcoin) permissioned chains:

* [BitcoinJ for MultiChain – a Java library](https://github.com/MultiChain/sample-bitcoinj).
* [BitcoinWallet for MultiChain – SPV wallet written in Java](https://github.com/MultiChain/sample-BitcoinWallet)
